**Abstract**

This study uncovered the UX of a Maltese utility provider (ARMS; Automated Revenue Management Services) by text-mining user-generated content (UGC) and user needs assessments on the initial application process. Apart from relying on the overall user experience expressed online, the current study detected UX attributes by using the first-time user experience (FTUE) as a gateway to develop actionable insights. For this, the study conducted word frequency analysis, topic modelling and sentiment analysis on 164 customer reviews and 5 user needs assessments. Findings from this study as as follows: 

**UGC: Word Frequencies**

‘Bills’ and ‘paying bills’ were the most prominent unigram and bigram respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that billing errors by utility providers are a common bane to many customers and ultimately to the energy sector. As for the trigram frequency analysis, a thorough examination revealed the following data:

- 13 trigrams related to negative customer care
- 7 trigrams related to political references and scandals
- 4 trigrams related to billing issues
- 2 trigrams related to internet banking
- 2 trigrams related to positive customer care
- 1 trigram related to average customer care
- 1 trigram related to the meter reading service
- 1 trigram related to the Google Chrome Browser

**UGC: Topic Modelling**

Based on the interpretation of the top-30 most relevant terms for topic 1, the interrelation between customer care and billing was the most common issue. 

**UGC: Sentiment Analysis**

To further zone in on pain points, it is imperative to find the reviews and comments with the worst sentiment scores. To this end, this study identified customer support and lack of visibility of system status as the worst paint points. 				
	
**User Needs Assessments: Word Frequencies**

Participants prominently mentioned the word ‘service’ and the bigram 'water and electricity' when describing their user needs and experiences. 'Paying bills' was another highly mentioned bigram posited to be one of the major paint points in this study. Lastly, the most prominent trigrams were as follows:

- 'Every 2 months': Participants mentioned their frequency of website visits and timing inconsistencies when receiving utility bills
- 'Previous Owner's Account': 2/5 participants applied for Form F (Registration for Change in Consumer)
- 'ARMS Office Valletta': 2/5 participants opted to go in person and register at the ARMS office in Valletta

**User Needs Assessments: Topic Modelling**

Consistent with word frequency findings, the top-30 most relevant terms for topic 1 revealed that ARMS' online presence and performance needs much improving across both desktop and mobile.

**User Needs Assessments: Sentiment Analysis**

Along with identifying consistent pain points in separate text mining analyses, sentiment analysis revealed ARMS' inconsistency in visibility of system status after applying and paying for a service as the worst paint point.

**Conclusion**

This study found a consistent usability issues across both UGC and user needs assessments. The chief causes of pain points reported in this study include a lack of digital capability to get closer to the user and neglect of customer care management.
