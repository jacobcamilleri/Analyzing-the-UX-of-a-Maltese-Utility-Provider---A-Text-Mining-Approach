       "39     Arms are a total disgrace. About 2 years ago they didn’t send me bills for 2 years and after going for about 7 times to their Valletta offices a certain Mr Paul Azzopardi managed to find out a mistake when they typed ‘Trejqa’ instead of Triq (their mistake) have had the same address for 40 years now and they charged me interest. A second time I found that they put 0 as persons on the bill instead of 1 and had to go several times to their Valletta offices and after a lot of hassles I was refunded with the extra money I had paid. It was well over 200 Euros. Now again, I hadn’t received a bill since January. Now a bill arrived period January to April 2020. After paying it by internet banking, (because I always pay on time) I checked the bill again and found that there was a previous invoice which was dated ‘March’ and which I never received, repeat, never received and they charged me 37c interest on this bill. I will be reporting this incident to the Consumers Authority. Arms Ltd.......shoddy service indeed!!!!\n",
