**Abstract**

This study uncovered the UX of a Maltese utility provider (ARMS; Automated Revenue Management Services) by text-mining user-generated content (UGC) and user needs assessments on the initial application process. Apart from relying on the overall user experience expressed online, the current study detected UX attributes by using the first-time user experience (FTUE) as a gateway to develop actionable insights. For this, the study conducted word frequency analysis, topic modelling and sentiment analysis on 164 customer reviews and 5 user needs assessments. Findings from this study as as follows: 

**UGC: Word Frequencies**

‘Bills’ and ‘paying bills’ were the most prominent unigram and bigram respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that billing errors by utility providers are a common bane to many customers and ultimately to the energy sector. As for the trigram frequency analysis, a thorough examination revealed the following data:

- 13 trigrams related to negative customer care
- 7 trigrams related to political references and scandals
- 4 trigrams related to billing issues
- 2 trigrams related to internet banking
- 2 trigrams related to positive customer care
- 1 trigram related to average customer care
- 1 trigram related to the meter reading service
- 1 trigram related to the Google Chrome Browser

**UGC: Topic Modelling**

Based on the interpretation of the top-30 most relevant terms for topic 1, the interrelation between customer care and billing was the most common issue. 

**UGC: Sentiment Analysis**

To further zone in on pain points, it is imperative to find the reviews and comments with the worst sentiment scores. To this end, this study identified 4 statements with sentiment scores of -1 which pertain to office location, website usability, customer care and overall experience. 				
	
**User Needs Assessments: Word Frequencies**

Participants prominently mentioned the word ‘service’ when describing their user journey from the initial application process, customer support and the final meter reading service. 

Whilst bigram frequency analysis revealed that ‘filling forms’ and ‘customer care’ were integral to the user journey, trigram frequency analysis provided deeper insights into the level of user satisfaction:

- 4 trigrams related to performing archaic procedures during the application process
- 3 trigrams related to lengthy duration of the application process
- 3 trigrams related to customer care issues
- 1 trigram related to the lack of visibility of system status
- 1 trigram related to changing utilities to a new homeowner

**User Needs Assessments: Topic Modelling**

Consistent with word frequency findings, the top-30 most relevant terms for topic 1 revealed that the application process took more time than expected due to customer care’s self-doubt on the provided service and users performing cumbersome and unintelligible procedures, both online and offline. 

**User Needs Assessments: Sentiment Analysis**

Along with identifying consistent pain points in separate text mining analyses, sentiment analysis revealed a mistrust in online government services with a score of -0.5. PPT01 believes that government digital services are particularly prone to bad UX and more is needed to address spillover effects and add value to their users.

**Conclusion**

This study found a consistent pattern of customer care issues across both UGC and user needs assessments. The chief causes of pain points reported in this study include a lack of digital capability to get closer to the user, company neglect of customer care management and misaligned UX urban design.
