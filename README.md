Research on the user experience (UX) of utility providers has become more important in a market-driven design paradigm because it helps researchers and designers to uncover significant factors in the customer journey. To this day, many utility providers are facing substantial issues in customer support, billing and application processes. The author proposes a framework for conducting text mining techniques (word frequencies, topic modelling, and sentiment analysis) and thematic coding analysis as ways to improve and enhance the UX of utility providers. Text mining on customer reviews and two user needs assessments were conducted on a Maltese utility provider (ARMS; Automated Revenue Management Service). Results from the customer review analysis indicate that the interrelation between customer support and electricity/water billing issues was more prominent than ever. Further, the user needs assessments revealed that a better customer support function was needed to enhance the first-time UX and the initial application process. Lastly, sentiment across the datasets was below average, especially when describing the archaic initial application process.
